# DV Multiplayer Mod

DV Multiplayer Mod is a modification to allow multiplayer in Derail Valley.

## Requirements

- [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)

## Installation

Download the mod from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/272)

Install the mod with Unity Mod Manager.

## Usage

When in game press the HOME key to open the menu (F7 in VR). In the menu you have the option to host your game or to connect to a game someone is hosting.

### Hosting
When hosting make sure you have port forwarded the port: 4296 UDP and 4296 TCP (unless you have changed this.)

*This mod does not have UPnP support.*

### Connecting
When connecting make sure you have the IP of the person you want to connect to. The port should be 4296 unless the host changed it.

## Supported mods
As of currently this mod has no real mod syncing this will maybe be added later but for now this is not the case. So if you use mods with the current save file please back the save file up so there are no game breaking issues that can corrupt your save game. You can test out if mods are compatible but remember to back your normal save up. I'm not reliable for your corrupted saves! [Skip tutorial?
